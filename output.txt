    This exam is open book, open notes, open Eclipse. However, you may not confer, consult, or collaborate with anyone. You must complete this exam entirely on your own, without help from others. (Note: You may find that it is more time efficient to answer all the questions from your understanding first, rather than take time to look them up, or run them through Eclipse to test them.)

    Do not discuss this exam with anyone in CSE 2221 who has not yet taken the exam.
